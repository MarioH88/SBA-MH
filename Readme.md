It consists of three pages:

2. Contact Us - Where I am located and a form to contact me.

3. Show off page is created HTML, CSS and Javascript. If you enter a letter, it would automatically filter it for you.For eg. If you just enter a single letter of the alphabet, it you display all entries that contain that alphabet. But if you enter the first three alphabets of the name, it would have a narrower search field.
